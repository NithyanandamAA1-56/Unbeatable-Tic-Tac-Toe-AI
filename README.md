Understanding the Minimax Algorithm The Minimax algorithm is a recursive search method used in game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming the opponent is also playing optimally. It operates on two concepts: Maximizing Player (AI): The AI seeks to maximize its score (the final evaluation of the board). A win has a high positive score. Minimizing Player (Human): The human opponent seeks to minimize the AI's score. A win for the human (a loss for the AI) has a high negative score. Key Steps: Terminal State Check: The function first checks if the current board state is an end-state (win, loss, or draw). AI Win \rightarrow Score \approx +10 Human Win \rightarrow Score \approx -10 Draw \rightarrow Score = 0 Recursion: For every non-terminal state, the algorithm: Simulates a move. Recursively calls itself for the opponent's turn. Undoes the move (backtracks) to explore other possibilities. Optimal Choice: The Maximizing player chooses the branch that leads to the move with the highest returned score. The Minimizing player chooses the branch that leads to the move with the lowest returned score. Minimax Scoring In the code: return 10 - depth: The AI prefers a win that happens in fewer moves (smaller depth). return depth - 10: The AI wants to avoid a loss that happens in fewer moves (smaller depth). This helps the AI prolong a game it's destined to lose. Alpha-Beta Pruning (Optional Optimization) While Minimax makes the AI unbeatable, it can be computationally expensive for complex games. For Tic-Tac-Toe, it's fast enough. Alpha-Beta Pruning is an optimization to Minimax. It works by: Pruning (cutting off) branches of the search tree that will never lead to a better result for the current player than a result already found. It effectively skips the evaluation of moves that are obviously worse than alternatives already explored, significantly speeding up the search without changing the final optimal move.# Unbeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
